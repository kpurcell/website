## About Me

I am [Kevin Purcell](http://impactstory.org/KevinPurcell) currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [J. Kevin Craig](http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/beaufort/staff/kevincraig.htm) at the [NOAA Southeast Fishery Science Center](http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/beaufort/) and [Duke Marine Lab](http://nicholas.duke.edu/marinelab) in [Beaufort](http://www.beaufortnc.org/), NC. My research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms by which populations deal with environmental disturbance.  Currently, I am collaborating on several projects aimed at examining the effects of coastal eutrophication and hypoxia on the economic and ecological dynamics of fisheries and nekton communities in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.  On this page you can find information about my [research](#research), [publications](#publications), [grants](#grants), [teaching experience](#teaching) and [presentations](#presentations).

## Research {#research}

My research program investigates how populations respond to changing environments.  I am particularly interested in the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms by which populations respond to anthropogenic disturbance over ecological time scales.  The mechanisms by which populations respond to changes in the environment can have dramatic consequences on their ecology and evolution.  Understanding these causal mechanisms provides valuable insights for the applied disciplines of conservation biology and resource management while advancing theoretical aspects of the ecological and evolutionary sciences.  I utilized a combination of experimental, molecular and statistical modeling approaches to address three broad questions: 

1. To what extent does the spatial and genetic structure of populations influence the effects of environmental stochasticity on population dynamics?  
2. What are the relative contributions of adaptation, plasticity and dispersal on the response of populations to biotic and abiotic stress?  
3. How do environmental and anthropogenic stochasticity interact with density-dependence to dictate the dynamics and distribution of populations and control the diversity and structure of communities?  

### Current Projects
Currently, I am involved in a collaboration between Duke University and NOAA Fisheries funded by the [Gulf of Mexico Ecosystem & Hypoxia Assessment (NGOMEX) Program](http://www.cop.noaa.gov/stressors/pollution/current/gomex-factsheet.aspx) through the [Center for Sponored Coastal Oceans Research (CSCOR)](http://www.cop.noaa.gov/).  I am examining the ecological and economic impact of multiple stressors (eutrophication, commercial fishing, and habitat degradation) on both commercial fishery populations and nektonic marine communities.  This project is largely computational using eco-informatics approaches to synthesize data from both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources.  

### Past Projects
A number of my previous research projects have sought to address these questions using the structurally complex and highly variable environment of coastal and marine ecosystems.  For example, my dissertation research focused on the implications of sea-level rise and fragmentation on the coastal estuaries of the northern Gulf of Mexico.  I used a quantitative genetics framework to show that in a period of less than 50 years there was observable phenotypic divergence between populations exposed to differing levels of salinity and that the mechanisms driving these phenotypic differences were genetic in nature [(*Evolutionary Applications 1 (1) 155–160*)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00001.x/full).  I employed an experimental common garden approach to evaluate the role of genetic adaptation on the demography of populations in disturbed coastal systems [(*Journal of Fish Biology 77(6) 1209-1218*)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02727.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false).  To understand the interplay of fragmentation, salinity stress and changes in population dynamics, I conducted a microsatellite survey to characterize the neutral diversity and the genetic structure of populations across a selective gradient [(*Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(11) 2623-2632*)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeb.12016/abstract;jsessionid=7EAE5BE1A2B6811796234393BDB7D8A3.f01t01?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false).  Additionally, I have used an invasive biology framework to further examine the central question of how populations respond to changing environments.  Specifically, I have developed a set of molecular markers [(*Conservation Genetic Resources 3(2) 361-363*)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12686-010-9362-7) for a highly invasive estuarine fish species to investigate the introduction history and evaluate the impact of serial introductions on the genetic diversity of these populations [(*Biological Invasions 14(10) 2057-2065*)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-012-0213-1).

## Teaching {#teaching}

### Philosophy
Teaching the sciences involves not only educating students in the fundamental topics and principles of the biological sciences, but also providing them with the intellectual tools that will allow them to develop into scientifically literate thinkers.  To this end, my teaching objectives are:  

1. to provide students with the subject mastery needed to proceed and excel with their course of study  
2. to cultivate strong critical thinking and reasoning skills which can be applied across disciplines  
3. to stimulate interest in the sciences and create scientifically literate students with the confidence to communicate that knowledge to others.  

To achieve my teaching objectives I develop learner-centered curricula using Bloom's taxonomy schema and a backward course design approach.  I am very interested in the interface between quantiative analysis and science pedagogy.  

### Experience

I have designed and taught a number of classes over the last several years.  

* **Introduction to Biology** (4 credit; 100/200 Level)  
* **Conservation Biology** (3 credit; 400/600 Level)  
* **Marine Invertebrates Lab** (1 credit; 400 level)  
* **Introduction to Biology Lab** (1 credit; 100/200 Level)
